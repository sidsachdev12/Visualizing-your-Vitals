## How to run the project?

Similar to homework and lab assignments, you need to start a localhost server.
One way to do this is run `python3 -m http.server` in the directory Visualizing-your-Vitals.
This should open up to `localhost:8000` and display index.html.

Alternatively, install LiveServer extension on VSCode, and run it through there.
